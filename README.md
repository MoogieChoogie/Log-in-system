Hi, this is just to check how comfortable I am with very very basic control flow statements in java.
I have no clue how to use github yet and what README is for.
For context, I did not think about the code by myself. I asked ChatGPT to give me a project so I could code it by myself, and also tell me how it should like like because I have no creativity e.g., Username: Password: and so on.
