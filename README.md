# Java Control Flow Practice Project

Hi, this project is a check on how comfortable I am with very very very basic control flow statements in Java.

## About This Project
- I am new to GitHub and still learning how to use it, I have no clue how to use this yet.
- I didn't originally think about the code by myself; I asked ChatGPT gave me a project idea.
- ChatGPT also helped me with how the code should look; I asked him to give me a template (e.g., How it should like like when ran the code is finished but not how it's coded).
- I coded everything myself and debugged it without external help :)
